PowerShell needs .\ to run a script in the current directory. You used \sync-env.ps1 (one backslash), so it’s looking for a path from the drive root.
From repo root (your usual):
.\scripts\keyvault\sync-env.ps1 -AppPath "C:\cevict-live\apps\praxis.original"
From scripts\keyvault:
.\sync-env.ps1 -AppPath "C:\cevict-live\apps\praxis.original"
Sync all apps (from repo root):
.\scripts\keyvault\sync-env.ps1 -All
Rule: use .\ before the script name so PowerShell runs the file in the current (or given) path instead of treating it as a global command.
