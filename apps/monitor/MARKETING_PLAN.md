## 1. Positioning

| | |
|---|----------------|
| **One-liner** | One dashboard for all your websites. Uptime, alerts, visitor stats, bot health. |
| **Audience** | Freelancers, agencies, indie hackers, dev teams with multiple sites |
| **Key benefit** | Stop juggling tools; see every site in one place; get alerted when something breaks |
| **Differentiator** | Simple, affordable, multi-site + bot health + AI assistant (not enterprise bloat) |

---

## 2. Goals (90 days)

- 500 landing visits, 50 sign-ups, 5 paid (Pro/Team).
- Establish Monitor as the “no-brainer” for anyone running 3+ client or side-project sites.

---

## 3. Channels & Tactics

- **SEO:** “website uptime monitoring for freelancers”, “multi-site monitoring”, “client site monitoring”.
- **Product-led:** 3 sites free; clear upgrade path on dashboard and `/landing`.
- **Paid:** LinkedIn and Twitter/X ads → “freelance developer”, “digital agency”, “indie hacker”. Small FB/IG if targeting small-business owners.
- **Community:** Indie Hackers, dev Discord/Slack, “tools for freelancers” threads.

---

## 4. Twitter / X post ideas (tonight or weekly)

Use your main account or a cevict.ai account. Keep under 280 chars; add `?utm_source=twitter` to links when possible.

- One dashboard for all your sites. Uptime, alerts, visitor stats. Built for freelancers and agencies. cevict.ai
- Stop checking 10 tabs. Monitor every client site in one place. 3 sites free. cevict.ai
- Your sites go down at 2am. We don’t. Uptime + SMS/email alerts in one dashboard. Start free → cevict.ai
- Built for people who run more than one website. No enterprise bloat. Just uptime, stats, and alerts. cevict.ai
- One place for uptime, response time, and visitor stats. 3 sites free. Upgrade when you need more. cevict.ai

---

## 5. Messaging by stage

- **Awareness:** “One dashboard for all your websites.”
- **Interest:** “Uptime, response time, visitor stats, and bot health in one place. Built for freelancers and agencies.”
- **Decision:** “Start free with 3 sites. Upgrade when you need more. No enterprise lock-in.”
- **CTA:** “Start free trial” / “Open dashboard” → `/landing` then sign-up.

---

## 6. Quick wins

1. Set `/landing` as default for unauthenticated visitors (optional redirect from `/`).
2. One clear “Start free” button above the fold on `/landing`.
3. “Powered by cevict.ai” on landing footer for cross-awareness with Praxis.

*Keys: Supabase, Anthropic (AI chat), optional Twilio/Resend for alerts. See README and `.env.example`.*
