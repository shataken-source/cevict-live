# Where To Vacation — Reference / Archive

**This folder is for reference only. Do not use as the main app.**

## What this is

- A restored backup of Where To Vacation (WTV) from after a mass deletion of apps.
- Kept for **reference**: extra docs, the `/reviews` page that was copied into the main app, and any other content you may want to port later.
- The **main** WTV app (with GCC integration, SSO, unified bookings/reviews) lives in:
  - **`apps/wheretovacation`** (the one to run and develop)

## What’s in here

- **app/reviews/page.tsx** — Guest reviews UI (already copied to main app).
- **PetReunion code** — Removed. It had been added to this backup by mistake (vault API). PetReunion lives in `apps/petreunion` and `apps/petreunion_v2` only.
- **docs/** — Various guides (launch checklist, API keys, scraper, social, etc.). Copy into main app or a shared docs folder as needed.

## Main app

Use and develop: **`C:\cevict-live\apps\wheretovacation`**

That app has full GCC integration (boats, integrated-search, unified-bookings, unified-reviews, SSO), Finn/Fishy AI, and now the reviews page.
