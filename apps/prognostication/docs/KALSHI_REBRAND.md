# 🎯 PROGNOSTICATION.COM → KALSHI PICKS REBRAND

## Why This Pivot Makes Sense

### The Problem with Sports Picks
- **Saturated Market**: Thousands of tipsters, touts, and services
- **Thin Margins**: Books are efficient, edge is small (51-54%)
- **High Competition**: ESPN, Action Network, PFF, etc. dominate
- **Commoditized**: Same data available to everyone

### The Kalshi Opportunity
- **First Mover Advantage**: Very few Kalshi pick services exist
- **Diverse Markets**: Politics, Economics, Weather, Entertainment, Crypto
- **Higher Edges**: Markets less efficient than sports
- **Legal & Regulated**: CFTC-regulated, legal in most US states
- **Binary Outcomes**: Easier to analyze YES/NO
- **Growing Platform**: $100M+ daily volume, increasing rapidly
