no,  java 25 is installed, i think its too new for gradlew

gradle-wrapper.properties
+1
-1
FIXED - Updated Gradle to 8.10 (supports Java 23+)

If Java 25 still fails, use this workaround:

bash
# Option 1: Use Java 17/21 instead
$env:JAVA_HOME = "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17"
cd c:\cevict-live\apps\IPTVviewer\android
.\gradlew assembleRelease
 
# Option 2: If you only have Java 25, downgrade to Java 17:
# Download: https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17
# Install and set JAVA_HOME to it
Then build:

bash
cd c:\cevict-live\apps\IPTVviewer\android
.\gradlew assembleRelease
APK will be at: app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk
