# PetReunion – Twitter / X post ideas

Post from **@PetReunion** (or your PetReunion Twitter) when you have access. **Standing permission:** Human will give agent access; agent decides what to post (not their app, not their decision). Keep under 280 chars. Add `?utm_source=twitter` to links when you can. Rotate 1–3 per week; mix emotional hooks with clear CTAs.
