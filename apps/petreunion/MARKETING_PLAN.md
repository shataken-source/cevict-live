# PetReunion — Marketing Plan (Starter)

**Tagline:** *Together We Bring Them Home*

**Doc purpose:** Living plan. Add sections and tactics below as you ship fixes and enhancements.

---

## 1. Pricing — Completely free (lead with this)

**Core product is 100% free. No catches.**

- **Report a lost pet** — free.
- **Report a found pet** — free.
- **Search all listings** — free. No sign-up required.
- **Pet of the Day, search, chatbot** — free.

**Optional paid tier (future):** *Reunion Ready* (or *Peace of Mind* — name TBD)  
For people who want to **add their pet’s profile before they ever go missing**. If the worst happens, one click and the listing goes live.  

- **Pricing (confirm before launch):** $9.99/year or $19.95/year (pick one or offer both; document final choice here).
- **Messaging:** “Everything else is free. This is just peace of mind if you want your pet already in the system.”

*Update this section when you lock the product name and price.*

## 2. Product summary (for messaging)

- **What:** **Completely free**, community-powered site to report lost/found pets and search listings. Optional yearly “Reunion Ready” tier to pre-register your pet (see §1).
- **Who:** Pet owners, finders, shelters, rescues, and neighborhood helpers.
- **Why:** One place to post and search—no fake listings, real reports only. And it’s free.
- **How:** Report lost or found → search by location/type → contact via listing; Pet of the Day and chatbot for guidance.
- **By whom:** **AI-written, AI-maintained.** The site and its marketing were built and are maintained by AI.

## 3. Goals (adjust as you go)

| Goal | Metric | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|
| Awareness | Monthly visitors / unique users | Track in Vercel/analytics |
| Trust | Reports submitted (lost + found) | Real user content = core signal |
| Engagement | Searches per session, return visits | Indicates usefulness |
| Reach | Pet of the Day shares (if you add tracking) | Optional later |

---

## 4. Target audiences

- **Primary:** People who just lost a pet or just found one (urgent, emotional).
- **Secondary:** Rescues, shelters, vet offices, community pages (recurring referrers).
- **Tertiary:** General pet owners (bookmark for “just in case,” share Pet of the Day).

---

## 5. Messaging pillars

- **Completely free:** “Report lost. Report found. Search. All free. No sign-up to search.” Lead with this everywhere.
- **Reunion:** “Get them home. One report, one search.”
- **Community:** “Neighbors and strangers helping each other.”
- **Trust:** “Real reports only. No fake or scraped listings.”
- **Optional peace of mind:** “Want your pet already in the system before they go missing? Reunion Ready is [price]/year. Everything else stays free.”
- **AI-built:** “AI-written, AI-maintained. This site was built and is maintained by AI.” Use in footer, about, and ad copy where it fits.

*(Add or change pillars when you add features—e.g. photos, alerts, maps.)*

## 6. Channels (start small, expand later)

| Channel | Use now | Add when … |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **SEO** | Title/description for home, /search, /report/lost, /report/found | You add city/state pages or blog |
| **Social (organic)** | Pet of the Day; “Report here” posts when you see lost-pet posts | You have consistent content or a content calendar |
| **Local/community** | One-pager or short link for “Report lost/found at [petreunion URL]” | You partner with shelters or neighborhoods |
| **Paid** | — | You have budget and a clear geo (e.g. one metro) |
| **Email** | — | You add sign-up (e.g. “alert me for this area”) |
| **Partnerships** | Vet/shelter/rescue “official reporting link” | You have a stable product and clear value prop |

---

## 7. Quick wins (no new features)

- [x] Set meta title/description on home, search, report/lost, report/found (SEO). **Include “Completely free” in home and search meta.**
- [ ] Add a clear “Share Pet of the Day” CTA if not already present.
- [ ] One “How it works” or “Report lost / Report found” explainer (can be a short section on home or its own page).
- [ ] Optional: Simple UTM or source field so you can see where reports come from (e.g. “facebook”, “flyer”).

## 8. Roadmap tie-ins (add as you implement)

*Use this section to log marketing actions that depend on product work.*

| When you ship … | Marketing action |
|------------------|------------------|
| **Reunion Ready / Peace of Mind** (pre-register pet, $9.99 or $19.95/yr) | Landing page; “Completely free — or add your pet before they go missing for [X]/year”; lock name + price in §1. |
| Photo upload / better photos | “Now with real photos” messaging; encourage “add a photo” in share copy |
| Location/map search | “Search by map” in meta and social copy; consider “lost pets near you” angle |
| Email or push alerts | “Get alerts when a pet is reported in your area” as main CTA |
| Mobile app or PWA | “Report from the field” and app-store listing |
| Shelter/rescue API or integration | Partner landing page and outreach to specific orgs |
| Fixes to search or reporting flow | Update “How it works” and any screenshots; A/B test copy if you run experiments |

---

## 9. Content ideas (backlog)

- **“Built by AI”** — Short explainer or badge: “AI-written, AI-maintained. This site and its marketing were created and are maintained by AI.”
- **“It’s completely free”** — Short explainer: what’s free (report lost, report found, search), what’s optional (Reunion Ready), no hidden costs.
- Short “What to do when you lose a pet” / “What to do when you find a pet” checklists.
- “Why we don’t use fake or scraped listings” (trust/transparency).
- Pet of the Day stories (with permission): “This pet was reunited because someone reported them here.”
- Local roundups: “Pets reported this week in [City]” (when you have enough data and privacy-safe approach).

---

## 10. Metrics to watch

- **Traffic:** Sessions, unique visitors, top pages.
- **Actions:** # lost reports, # found reports, # searches (if you can log them).
- **Quality:** Bounce rate on /search, time on site, repeat visits.
- **Growth:** Week-over-week or month-over-month change in reports and searches.

*(Add links to dashboards or tools when you set them up.)*

## 11. Next steps (pick 1–2)

1. Implement the Quick wins in §7 (meta tags, share CTA, “How it works”). Lead with “Completely free” in meta.
2. When you lock Reunion Ready pricing ($9.99 vs $19.95/year), update §1 and §5.
3. Add one “Add when we implement” row to §8 for your next planned fix or enhancement.

*Last updated: 2025-02 — expand this doc as you implement fixes and enhancements.*
