## ⚠️ Note About CLI Deployment

The Vercel CLI is showing a path configuration issue. This doesn't affect:
- ✅ Git-based auto-deployments (which are working)
- ✅ The production site (which is live)

**To fix the CLI issue later:**
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/shataken-sources-projects/petreunion/settings/general
2. Check "Root Directory" setting
3. It should be: `apps/petreunion` (not `apps/petreunion/apps/petreunion`)

## ✅ What Was Deployed

- Help bot integration
- Found pet reporting page
- Navigation improvements
- Deployment documentation files

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for Vercel to build and deploy
2. **Check the deployments page** to see build status
3. **Visit the production site** to verify changes are live

The deployment is in progress! 🚀
