Common Issues When Adding Pets

Issue: "I can't submit my report"

Checklist:
1. ✅ Pet Type selected (Dog or Cat)
2. ✅ Color entered (not empty)
3. ✅ Date Lost selected (not in future, not more than 10 years ago)
4. ✅ Location entered with city AND state
5. ✅ Email format correct (if provided)
6. ✅ Phone number format correct (if provided)

If all checked but still not working:
- Look for red error messages on the form
- Check each field for specific error text
- Try refreshing the page and starting over

Issue: "Location error - Please enter location"

Problem: Location field requires BOTH city AND state

Correct Examples:
✅ "Columbus Indiana"
✅ "Columbus, Indiana"  
✅ "Columbus, IN"
✅ "Indianapolis IN"

Wrong Examples:
❌ "Columbus" (missing state)
❌ "Indiana" (missing city)
❌ Empty field

Solution: Always include city and state, separated by comma or space.

Issue: "Date error - Date cannot be in future"

Problem: Selected a future date

Solution: 
- Click the date field
- Select today's date or a past date
- The calendar won't let you select future dates, but if you type manually, make sure it's not in the future

Issue: "Email format error"

Problem: Email address format is incorrect

Correct Format:
✅ yourname@email.com
✅ user.name@example.org
✅ test123@gmail.com

Wrong Format:
❌ yourname@email (missing .com)
❌ @email.com (missing username)
❌ yourname email.com (missing @)
❌ yourname@ (incomplete)

Solution: Make sure email has:
- Username before @
- @ symbol
- Domain name
- Top-level domain (.com, .org, etc.)

Issue: "Phone number error"

Problem: Phone number doesn't have 10-15 digits

Correct Formats:
✅ (555) 123-4567
✅ 555-123-4567
✅ 5551234567
✅ +1 555 123 4567

Wrong Formats:
❌ 555-123 (too short, needs 10 digits minimum)
❌ abc-def-ghij (contains letters)
❌ Empty if you want to include it

Solution: Enter 10-15 digits. Spaces, dashes, and parentheses are okay - they'll be removed automatically.

Issue: "Field is too long"

Problem: Text exceeds maximum character limit

Character Limits:
- Pet Name: 100 characters
- Breed: 100 characters
- Color: 50 characters
- Description: 2000 characters
- Location: 200 characters
- Owner Name: 100 characters
- Email: 255 characters
- Phone: 20 characters

Solution: Shorten the text to fit within limits. For descriptions, focus on most important details.

Issue: "Form won't submit / Submit button doesn't work"

Possible Causes:
1. Required field is empty (check for red asterisks *)
2. Validation error (look for red error messages)
3. Browser issue
4. Internet connection problem

Solutions:
1. Scroll through form and check all required fields
2. Look for red error messages above the submit button
3. Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
4. Check your internet connection
5. Refresh the page and try again
6. Clear browser cache

Issue: "Success message but report not in search"

Possible Causes:
1. Report needs a moment to appear
2. Search filters are hiding it
3. Wrong search terms

Solutions:
1. Wait 10-30 seconds and refresh search page
2. Clear all filters and search again
3. Search by your pet's name
4. Search by location (city name)
5. Make sure status filter is set to "All" or "Lost"

Issue: "Can't find the Report Lost Pet button"

Solution:
- Go to homepage: petreunion.com
- Click the card that says "Report Lost Pet" (red icon with AlertCircle)
- Or go directly to: petreunion.com/report/lost

Issue: "Search not working / No results"

Solutions:
1. Try broader search terms:
   - Instead of "Golden Retriever", try "dog"
   - Instead of "Buddy", try searching by location
2. Clear all filters
3. Check spelling
4. Try different search terms
5. Make sure you're searching in the right status (Lost vs Found)

Issue: "Page won't load"

Solutions:
1. Check internet connection
2. Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
3. Clear browser cache
4. Try a different browser
5. Check if other websites load (to rule out internet issue)
6. Try on mobile device if desktop isn't working

Issue: "Form fields are cut off / Can't see all fields"

Solutions:
1. Scroll down on the page
2. Zoom out (Ctrl + minus key, or Cmd + minus on Mac)
3. Try on a larger screen
4. Use mobile device (form is mobile-friendly)
5. Check browser zoom level (should be 100%)

Issue: "Date picker not showing"

Solutions:
1. Click directly on the date field
2. Make sure JavaScript is enabled
3. Try a different browser
4. Try on mobile device (date picker works better on mobile)
5. You can also type the date manually in format: YYYY-MM-DD

Issue: "Can't select pet type"

Solutions:
1. Click the dropdown arrow
2. Make sure you're clicking on the select box, not just the label
3. Try clicking different parts of the dropdown
4. Try keyboard: Click field, then use arrow keys and Enter
5. Try a different browser

Issue: "Description field too small"

Solution: The description field expands as you type. You can also:
- Resize your browser window
- The field will show character count (e.g., "150 / 2000 characters")
- Focus on most important details if hitting limit

Issue: "Submitted but got error message"

Read the error message carefully:
- It will tell you which field has the problem
- Fix that specific field
- Try submitting again

Common error messages:
- "Please enter the location..." → Add city AND state
- "Please enter your pet's color" → Fill in color field
- "Please select the date..." → Select a date
- "Please enter a valid email" → Fix email format
- "Please enter a valid phone number" → Fix phone format

Issue: "Want to edit my report after submitting"

Current Status: Editing is not available yet, but coming soon!

Workaround:
- Contact support to update your report
- Or submit a new report with updated information
- Note in description that it's an update

Issue: "Can't upload photos"

Current Status: Photo upload is coming soon!

For now:
- Use the Description field to describe your pet in detail
- Include distinctive markings, colors, size
- Mention if they have a collar, tags, or microchip
- Be as detailed as possible

Issue: "Report found pet form is different"

The "Report Found Pet" form is similar but asks for:
- Where you found the pet (instead of where lost)
- Date found (instead of date lost)
- Same pet information fields

All the same troubleshooting applies!
