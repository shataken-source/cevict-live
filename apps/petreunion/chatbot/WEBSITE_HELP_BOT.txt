How to Report a Found Pet

The process is similar to reporting a lost pet:

1. Go to "Report Found Pet" on homepage
2. Fill out the form with:
   - Pet information (type, breed, color, etc.)
   - Where you found them
   - When you found them
   - Your contact information
3. Submit the report
4. Our system will automatically search for matching lost pet reports

Important: If the pet has a collar with tags, check those first before reporting!

Understanding Pet Status

Lost: Pet is missing, owner is searching
Found: Pet has been found, waiting to be reunited
Reunited: Pet has been successfully reunited with owner

When you find your pet, update your report status to "Reunited" so others know the search is complete.

✅ CORRECT Formats:
- "Columbus Indiana"
