# Ring Search Party — use with PetReunion for lost dogs

Ring’s **Search Party** (promoted in part via Super Bowl–era ads) helps find lost **dogs** using AI and the Neighbors community. PetReunion doesn’t integrate with Ring (they don’t offer a public API), but we recommend using both.

## What Ring Search Party does

- **Report a lost dog** in the Ring app’s Neighbors section (photo + description). You don’t need a Ring camera or subscription to report.
- **AI search**: Ring uses AI to scan footage from nearby **outdoor** Ring cameras for dogs matching your pet.
- **Neighbors help**: When a potential match is found, nearby camera owners get a notification and can share clips or contact you. Nothing is shared automatically; they choose.
- **Availability**: U.S. only. Works with outdoor Ring doorbells and cameras (not indoor).
- **Privacy**: Users can turn Search Party on/off and choose whether to share video. Alerts end after a few hours unless you confirm you’re still searching.

## How we use it in PetReunion

- **First 24 hours** checklist: we tell users with a lost dog to also start a Search Party in Ring (in addition to reporting here and posting on social/flyers).
- **Homepage**: we link to Ring Search Party under “Also try” so people know about it.

## For product/ideas

- No API exists for third-party integration. We only recommend it and link out.
- If Ring ever offers a “report lost pet” or Neighbors API, we could revisit linking or embedding.
