## 📋 What the Project Looks Like

When you find it, you'll see:
- **Project name:** `petreunion`
- **Production URL:** `https://petreunion-shataken-sources-projects.vercel.app`
- **Status:** Active
- **Last deployment:** 2 days ago

---

## ✅ Quick Test

**Try this URL right now:**
```
https://vercel.com/shataken-sources-projects/petreunion/deployments
```

If this works, you're in! If it says "not found" or asks you to log in, you might be:
- Logged into a different account
- Not part of the `shataken-sources-projects` team
- Need to accept a team invitation

---

## 🆘 Last Resort

If none of this works, the project might be in a different Vercel account. In that case:

1. **Check your email** for Vercel team invitations
2. **Or create a new project** with a different name (like `petreunion-v2`)
3. **Or tell me** and I can help you set it up fresh
