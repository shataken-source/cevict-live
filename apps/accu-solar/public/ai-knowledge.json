      "content": "For a 12V system with 8× 280Ah batteries (26.9 kWh), size your inverter to your peak simultaneous load.\n\n**Recommendations by load:**\n- 2000W continuous: Renogy 2000W Pure Sine (~$200)\n- 3000W continuous: Giandel 3000W (~$280)\n- 5000W continuous: Aims Power 5000W (~$450)\n\n**Rule:** Size to 1.25× your largest simultaneous load. Pure sine wave is required for sensitive electronics, motors, and appliances.\n\n**12V note:** High-wattage inverters (3000W+) draw 250A+ from a 12V bank. Use short, thick cables (2/0 AWG or larger) and a proper fuse within 18 inches of the battery."

Watch for overnight temps dropping below freezing.\n\n**Solutions for cold climates:**\n1. **Self-heating BMS:** Some JBD BMS units have a heating pad — check your BMS app\n2. **Insulated enclosure:** Foam insulation around battery bank retains heat from normal operation\n3. **Low-temp cutoff:** Set your BMS to stop charging below 5°C as a safety margin\n\n**Capacity loss:** At 0°C, LiFePO4 delivers ~80% of rated capacity.

No separate charge controller needed.\n\n**Solar wiring for EG4:**\n- Your 4S2P array: ~74V Voc, ~32A — well within 500V limit ✅\n- Connect MC4 cables from PV disconnect directly to EG4 PV+ and PV−\n\n**First power-up:** Always use a pre-charge resistor (20–30Ω, 10W) across the DC breaker terminals for 10 seconds before flipping the breaker ON. This prevents capacitor inrush damage."

PV Disconnect: **OFF**\n2. DC Main Breaker: **OFF**\n3. Hold the resistor across both studs of the 150A DC Main Breaker (In and Out terminals)\n4.
