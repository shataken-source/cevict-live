# Reference backup (newer)

This folder is a **reference copy** of a WTV/GCC-related backup. Use it for comparison or to pull specs into the live app (`apps/wheretovacation`), not as the runnable app.

## Key docs added here

- **WHERETOVACATION_INTEGRATION.md** – From Downloads. GCC ↔ WTV integration (SSO, shared_users, API, package deals).
- **AUDIT_GCC_AND_WHERETOVACATION.md** – From Downloads. Jan 2026 audit of GCC + WTV (structure, security, unified booking fix, env, ESLint).
- **FEATURE_CROSS_REFERENCE_CHECKLIST.md** – From `C:\gcc\fishystuff`.
- **FINAL_REVENUE_PROJECTIONS.md** – From `C:\gcc\fishystuff`.
- **PWA_MEDIA_STRATEGY_COMPLETE_SPEC.md** – From `C:\gcc\fishystuff`.

Rest of the tree (app/, components/, lib/, etc.) is from your extracted backup; it may overlap with other backups or with `docs/from-gcc/`. The live app is `c:\cevict-live\apps\wheretovacation` (parent repo).

**Canonical copies:** For reading (not diffing), use the main docs folder: `docs/README.md` (index), `docs/AUDIT_GCC_AND_WHERETOVACATION.md`, and `docs/from-gcc/WHERETOVACATION_INTEGRATION.md`.
