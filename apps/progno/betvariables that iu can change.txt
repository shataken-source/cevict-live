How to Use
Local development: Add to c:\cevict-live\apps\progno.env.local

Production (Vercel): Add in Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables

Example - More aggressive picks:

bash
PROGNO_MIN_CONFIDENCE=50    # Lower threshold
PROGNO_MAX_ODDS=800         # Allow bigger underdogs
HOME_ONLY_MODE=0            # Include away picks
Example - More conservative:

bash
PROGNO_MIN_CONFIDENCE=65    # Higher threshold
PROGNO_MAX_ODDS=300         # Only slight underdogs
PROGNO_MIN_ODDS=-150        # Only slight favorites
