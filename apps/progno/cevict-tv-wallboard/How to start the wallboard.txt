How to start the wallboard (for next time)
You need two things running:

1. Progno API (port 3008)
bash
cd c:\cevict-live\apps\progno
npx next dev -p 3008
This serves the picks/stats/predictions API that the wallboard fetches from.

2. Wallboard server (port 3434)
bash
cd c:\cevict-live\apps\progno\wallboard
node server.js
This serves the wallboard HTML/JS and proxies /api/* calls to Progno on port 3008.

Then open
http://localhost:3434
On your TV browser, use your machine's IP instead: http://192.168.8.152:3434
