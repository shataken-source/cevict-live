## 🧮 COMBINED CLAUDE EFFECT FORMULA

```
FULL IMPLEMENTATION (All 7 Phases):
CLAUDE_EFFECT = (w₁×SF) + (w₂×NM) + (w₃×IAI) + (w₄×CSI) + (w₅×NIG) + (w₆×TRD) + (w₇×EPD)

Weights:
- w₁ (Sentiment) = 0.15
- w₂ (Narrative) = 0.12
- w₃ (Information) = 0.20
- w₄ (Chaos) = 0.10 (affects CONFIDENCE, not probability)
- w₅ (Network) = 0.13
- w₆ (Temporal) = 0.10 (applied as multiplier)
- w₇ (Emergent) = 0.20

MAX_IMPACT = ±15%
CSI affects CONFIDENCE: Base_Confidence × (1 - CSI_Penalty)
TRD applied as multiplier to all other dimensions
```
