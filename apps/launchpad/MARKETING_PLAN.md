# Marketing Plan: Launchpad

CEVICT ops dashboard: one place to see all your projects, health, start/stop, and Command Center (AI messaging, logs, risk factors). For devs and teams running many apps.

---

## 1. Positioning

| | |
|---|----------------|
| **One-liner** | One dashboard for your whole app stack. Health, start/stop, Command Center, AI messaging. |
| **Audience** | Indie devs, small teams, and ops people running 5+ projects (monorepos, microservices, side projects) |
| **Key benefit** | Stop switching windows and terminals; one grid for status, one place to start/stop and send AI context |
| **Differentiator** | Project grid + Command Center (per-project health, AI message to Cursor/Claude/Gemini), key distribution, no generic “status page” bloat |

---

## 2. Goals (90 days)

- 200 visits to landing/demo (if you add a public page), 30 “try it” or installs, 5 power users (you + a few others).
- Establish Launchpad as the “ops home” for CEVICT and for anyone with a similar multi-project setup.

---

## 3. Channels & Tactics

- **Organic:** Short posts in Indie Hackers, dev Twitter/X, “how I run 10 side projects” threads. Focus on “one dashboard for all my projects” and “Command Center = send context to Cursor/Claude”.
- **Content:** One post or thread: “How I run 12+ apps from one dashboard (health, start/stop, AI messaging)” with a short video or screenshots. Link to Launchpad or cevict.ai.
- **Product-led:** If you ever offer a cloud or “Launchpad Lite” for others, free tier = 5 projects, paid = more + optional shared Command Center.
- **Twitter/X:** See tweet ideas below. Post from main or cevict account when you ship something that used Launchpad.

## 4. Twitter / X post ideas

- One dashboard for my whole app stack. Health, start/stop, and a Command Center that messages Cursor/Claude. Built for running 10+ projects without the chaos. cevict.ai
- Tired of 10 terminals and 10 tabs? Launchpad: project grid, health checks, start/stop, and AI context in one place. cevict.ai
- We run 12+ apps. Launchpad is our ops home: one grid, per-project health, and “send to Cursor” so the right context gets to the right agent. cevict.ai
- Command Center: one place to see which projects are up, restart them, and send AI messages to Claude/Cursor. No more copy-pasting logs. cevict.ai
- If you run a monorepo or a bunch of side projects, you need one dashboard. Launchpad = grid + health + start/stop + AI messaging. cevict.ai

## 5. Messaging by stage

- **Awareness:** “One dashboard for your whole app stack.”
- **Interest:** “Project grid, health, start/stop, and Command Center: per-project tabs, AI message to Cursor/Claude/Gemini, logs, risk factors.”
- **Decision:** “Built for devs who run many projects. No enterprise lock-in; your data, your keys.”
- **CTA:** “Try Launchpad” / “Open dashboard” (link to your hosted Launchpad or install instructions).

## 6. Keys & setup

Launchpad may need env/keys for: Supabase (if you persist projects), optional Vercel/cron/health endpoints. See `README.md` and `env.manifest.json` in the app. Play with it and add any missing keys as you go.
